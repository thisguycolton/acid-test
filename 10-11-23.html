						The word step is both a verb and a noun.
					</p>
					<p>
						When most of us think of the word, we tend to envision a step on a staircase—a static object that helps us move upward and forward. But the Twelve Steps are neither static nor objects. A step is also an action that can be performed by the body and the mind. This definition best embodies the Twelve Steps. They are living steps—as well as steps for living.
					</p>
					<p>
						A list of the Twelve Steps, as they appear in the Big Book, hangs on the wall at most recovery group meetings. But these words themselves aren’t the Steps; they’re a summary of the Steps. We don’t work the Steps by reciting them, discussing them, and reflecting on them. We work the Steps by practicing them in all our affairs, as Step Twelve reminds us.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a Twelve Step meeting focuses on Step Six, Seven, or both, the meeting tends to be short. People generally don’t have much to say about those Steps, perhaps because of the Big Book’s lack of concrete direction about them, as noted earlier.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result, many of us in recovery don’t actually work Steps Six and Seven—some call them the drive-by Steps. Instead, we recite them, discuss them, study them, and reflect on them. We practice the summaries on the wall instead of the Steps themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was certainly true in my case. I was sober for twelve years before I saw the difference between the Steps on the wall and the deeply human activity of working them.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Steps on the wall are only the Cliffs Notes version of the Twelve Steps. Back in high school, if you had read the Cliffs Notes for The Great Gatsby but not the actual novel, you probably would have been able to pass a multiple-choice test on the book. You might even have been able to discuss it fairly intelligently. But you wouldn’t have actually experienced the novel. You’d have missed its essence—as well as the pleasure of experiencing all the events in it and the development of the characters as they unfolded.
