      	<h2 class="font-weight-bold">Welcome to the Voyage of Recovery</h2>
      	<hr>
			  <blockquote class="blockquote">

				  <p>
						You may be familiar with some version of the Drop the Rock parable. It’s about the Twelve Step group members who set sail on the ship Recovery across the sea of Life for the island of Serenity. As the parable is usually told, soon after the boat pulls away from the dock, the passengers realize that some of their friends are not yet on board.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sure enough, their friend Mary comes running down the street and onto the dock. The people on the boat cheer her on. “Dive in and swim, Mary!” they shout. “You can do it!” Mary dives into the water and swims for the boat as fast and hard as she can. But as she gets close to the boat, she slows and struggles to stay afloat. Everyone on board can see why: a heavy rock is hanging from a snarl of strings around Mary’s neck. “Drop the rock!” they all shout. “Let go! Drop the rock!”
					</p>
					<p>
						Treading water, Mary looks down at the rock. She realizes it contains her fear, resentments, self-pity, anger, intolerance, resentments, and other character flaws. She also realizes that if she doesn’t let go of them, she will drown.
					</p>
					<p>
						She tears off the strings, holds the rock away from her body, and lets it go.
					</p>
					<p>
						Freed of the heavy and useless weight, Mary easily swims the rest of the way to the boat. She climbs aboard, dripping and deeply relieved. When most people tell this story, this is where they stop. That’s understandable, because that part alone is useful and instructive.
					</p>
					<p>
						But here’s how that parable might continue: As Mary is drying off, she notices something heavy in her pants pocket. She reaches in and discovers another rock, although much smaller than the one she’d just released. She recognizes this as her character defect of self-centeredness and immediately tosses it into the water.
					</p>
					<p>
						As everyone congratulates Mary, they look back toward shore. Someone else is in the water, swimming desperately toward the boat. But that person, too, is being pulled underwater after every few strokes. As the swimmer gets closer to the boat, Mary can see that it’s Ramon, her old friend and—before they went through treatment together—drinking buddy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mary runs to the rail, leans over, and shouts, “Hey, Ramon, it’s me, Mary! Drop the rock! Can you see the ripples from the rocks I just dropped? We don’t have to carry around our character defects any more. If I can do it, you can!”
					</p>
					<p>
						As the ripples from Mary’s rocks reach Ramon, he pulls the strings off his shoulders and raises his hand above his head in a thumbs-up.
					</p>
					<p>
						“You’re almost there!” Mary shouts.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I’m coming!” Ramon shouts back.
					</p>
					<p>
						He dives under the ripples and disappears. Half a minute later, his head pops out of the water, only thirty feet from the boat.
					</p>
					<p>
						He disappears beneath the water again. Everyone on board watches breathlessly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then suddenly Ramon appears next to the boat, just below Mary. He gasps, “Help me in!”
					</p>
					<p>
						Mary leans over, stretches out her arm, and pulls Ramon aboard.
					</p>
